# ga_navigator
The genetic algorithm navigator is a program developed to demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm in path creating situations. A population of AI players are generated, each of which is its own independently controlled thread. The AI players will initially navigate at random and through the use of core genetic algorithm concepts (ex. crossovers, mutations, fitness, etc.) the AI population will generate offspring with a potentially a higher fitness. Subsequent generations will be more adept than the previous and through this simulated genetic process the AIs will learn to find the shortest path to the goal location.
